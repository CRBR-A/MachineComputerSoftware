  TinyWM is a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in minimalism.
  It is also maybe helpful in learning some of the very basics of creating a 
  window manager. It is only around 50 lines of C. There is also a Python 
  version using python-xlib.
  It lets you do four basic things:
  - Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 drag (left mouse button)
  - Resize windows interactively with Alt+Button3 drag (right mouse button)
  - Raise windows with Alt+F1 (not high on usability I know, but I needed a 
  keybinding in there somewhere)
  - Focus windows with the mouse pointer (X does this on its own)
